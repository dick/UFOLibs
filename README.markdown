## What Is It?

UFOLibs is a toy web app built on Sinatra to show off the Infochimps UFO Incident Search API. 

Data is from a comprehensive listing of over 60,000 unidentified-flying-object (UFO) sightings in the United States (and some elsewhere).

Go to http://ufolibs.heroku.com to see it in action.
